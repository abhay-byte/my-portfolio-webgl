# My Interactive 3D Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome.

I'm **Abhay Raj**, a game developer, and this is the repository for my interactive 3D portfolio.

I wanted to create something that does more than just *tell* you what I can do—I wanted to *show* you. So, I built my personal website as a small, interactive 3D world where my work and my passion for game development come together.

## 🚗 About This Project

Instead of a standard, scrollable webpage, I've created a low-poly environment where you can drive a car to explore. I designed it to be a fun, engaging experience that reflects the kind of work I love to do. As you navigate the scene, you'll find key information and instructions integrated directly into the environment.

## 🕹️ How to Explore

Getting around is easy! Just use the following controls:

*   **Arrow Keys:** To drive the car.
*   **Space Bar or Mouse Click:** To interact with elements and visit links.

## 🛠️ Tech I Used

I brought this project to life using a few of my favorite tools:

*   **Unity:** The core 3D engine I used to build the entire experience.
*   **WebGL:** The technology that allows the Unity project to run smoothly in a web browser.
*   **Firebase:** My choice for simple and reliable web hosting.

## 📂 Get Involved

This was a personal project, but I believe in sharing knowledge. You are welcome to:

*   **Star the repository** if you find it interesting!
*   **Fork the project** and play around with the code.
*   **Open an issue** if you find any bugs or have suggestions.

Thanks for stopping by
